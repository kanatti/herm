# zk-async : Async client for Zookeeper

We don't actually need to implement this, instead could use [tokio-zookeeper](https://github.com/stackabletech/tokio-zookeeper) or [rust-zookeeper](https://github.com/bonifaido/rust-zookeeper) packages.

But to get some hands-on experience on writing intermediate rust-code, we will follow [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMuk8Rn9HBg) by [@jonhoo](https://github.com/jonhoo/) and implement it from scratch.
